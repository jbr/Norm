h2. Norm -- The Norm Object Relational Mapper

* Norm is a bad idea.  That's okay.  It's just for practice.
* Norm makes RDBMS purists cry.  Crying isn't ACID compliant.
* Norm defines the database schema as it is used.
* Norm is semi-kinda-sorta inspired by jQuery.
* Norm takes "convention over configuration" seriously.
* Norm is Not an ORM, really, in that it'll never be a full-fledged ORM.
* Norm only depends on the mysql gem.  Requiring activesupport would make some things easier, but is not within the scope of this experiment.

bc. require 'norm'
Norm.database = "norm"
desk = Norm::Desk.new :height => '3 feet', :depth => '2 feet', :width => '2 feet'


will connect to database "norm," create a table "desk," and add three columns to it, as well as making and saving the first record, which can now be accessed like @Norm::Desk.first@, @Norm::Desk[desk.id]@, @Norm::Desk['where height = "3 feet"']@, or (at this point), @Norm::Desk.all@

h3. Caveats
* Norm is MySQL-only and probably will always be that way.
* Norm is not intended to be used for anything serious.  Norm is an experiment and a self-educational lesson.

h3. Basics

You can make a new Norm class (and table) as simply as

bc. require 'norm'
class Desk
  include Norm
end

or, for a bit of lazy:

bc. require 'norm'
Norm::Desk

either of which will make a table @`desk`@ on definition.

* @d = Desk.new@ both makes and saves a new desk, auto-incrementing an id column (@d.id@).
* @d.purpose = 'writing'@ adds a column @desk.purpose@ in mysql and sets it for the row with id @d.id@.
* @d.delete@ deletes that desk.

h3. Associations

Norm operates on the convention that associations are named the same thing as the associated table name.  The association is singular whether or not it's a plural association.  You're a programmer, you can live without pluralization.

bc.. require 'norm'
p = Parent.new
c1 = Child.new
c2 = Child.new

c1.parent = p
c2.parent = p

p.child.size #=> 2

h3. That's all for now.  Hope you think it's interesting!
